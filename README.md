(5 points) Start with an array called table. The array should have numbers between 1 and 10.

(30 points) Use table to create the following: –
Set of multiples of 5 between 1 and 51. Name it fiveTable
Set of multiples of 10 between 1 and 101. Name it tenTable
Set of squares of numbers in table. Name it squaresTable
(10 points) Get the odd multiples of 5 between 1 and 100. 5, 15, …
(20 points) Get the sum of even multiples of 7 between 1 and 100. 14 + 28+…
(15 points) Use currying to rewrite the function below: –
function cylinder_volume(r, h){

var volume = 0.0;

volume = 3.14 * r * r * h;

return volume;

}

Use r = 5 and h = 10 to call your curried function.

(15 points) Use the following code to take advantage of closure to wrap content with HTML tags, specifically show an HTML table consisting of a table row that has at least one table cell/element. You can use the console to output your results.
makeTag = function(beginTag, endTag){

return function(textcontent){

return beginTag +textcontent +endTag;

}

}

(5 points) Following instructions
(Extra credit) Do the generic version of questions 3 and 4 – first odd or even and then the number whose multiples (in range 1 to 100) you want.
